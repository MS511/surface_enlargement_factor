## Surface Enlargement Factor (mathematical framework)

When surface topographies are recorded using confocal Raman microscopy or atomic force microscopy, the resulting data is arranged on a regular grid. A triangular mesh is then constructed over the grid to approximate the true surface area. The ratio between the calculated (true) surface area and the projected geometric area defines the **Surface Enlargement Factor (SEF)**, which quantifies the increase in area due to roughness.

Surface topography data is provided as a 2D array of height values z_{i,j} on a grid of coordinates (x_i,y_j) with uniform spacings delta_x and delta_y. For each grid cell defined by points  
(i,j), (i+1,j), (i,j+1), and (i+1,j+1), two triangles are constructed:

1. **First Triangle:**  
   Formed by the points  
   (x_i,y_j,z_{i,j}) (top-left),  
   (x_{i+1},y_j, z_{i+1,j}) (bottom-left), and  
   (x_{i+1},y_{j+1}, z_{i+1,j+1}) (bottom-right).

2. **Second Triangle:**  
   Formed by the points  
   (x_i, y_j, z_{i,j}) (top-left),  
   (x_{i+1}, y_{j+1}, z_{i+1,j+1}) (bottom-right), and  
   (x_i, y_{j+1}, z_{i,j+1}) (top-right).

For each triangle with vertices A, B, and C, the side lengths are computed as

a = |B - A|,
b = |C - B|,
c = |A - C|.

The semiperimeter s is

s = (a+b+c)/2,

and the area of the triangle is given by Heron's formula:

A_{triangle} = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)).

The 'true' surface area is obtained by summing the areas of all triangles:

A_{surface} = sum_{k=1}^{M} (A_{triangle_k}),

while the projected geometric area is

A_{{geometric} = (N_x - 1)(N_y - 1) delta_x delta_y.

Finally, the SEF is defined as

SEF = A_{surface}/A_{geometric}).

A finer grid (smaller delta_x and delta_y) improves the resolution of the mesh and the accuracy of the SEF, thereby capturing the nuances of surface roughness.
